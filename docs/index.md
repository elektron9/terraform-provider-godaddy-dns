  Manage DNS resource records for domains hosted on GoDaddy

# GoDaddyDNS provider: `godaddy-dns`

This module allows to manage individual DNS resource records for domains
hosted on GoDaddy DNS servers, using [management API](https://developer.godaddy.com/).

It manages only DNS resources (no e.g. domain management) and aim to manage
individual DNS resource records (not the whole domain), while preserving existant
records and tolerating external modifications (as far as possible).

Provider configuration is pretty trivial and usually empty, providing that
authentication info is set in environment variables `GODADDY_API_KEY` and
`GODADDY_API_SECRET` (see developer docs above for instructions on how to
get them). Alternatively, they could be set in `api_key` and `api_secret`
parameters in provider configuration.

# DNS Record resource : `dns_record`

To manage DNS RRs they are described as instances of `dns_records` resource.

It currently supports `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS` and `TXT` records, the only
omission being `SRV` (if anyone hosting AD on GoDaddy or uses them for VOIP or
something like that, please let me know by creating an issue).

Example usage:

```terraform
provider "godaddy-dns" {
  api_key    = "better set it in GODADDY_API_KEY"
  api_secret = "better set it in GODADDY_API_SECRET"
}

# create "alias.test.com" as as CNAME for "other.com"
resource "godaddy-dns_record" "my-cname" {
  domain = "test.com"
  type   = "CNAME"
  name   = "alias"
  data   = "other.com"
}
```

To set several records, `for_each` could be used:

```terraform
# one record
resource "godaddy-dns_record" "one-cname" {
  domain = "mydomain.com"
  type   = "CNAME"
  name   = "redirect"
  data   = "target.otherdomain.com"
}

locals {
  records = {
    "mx1" = {
      type = "MX",
      name = "@",
      data = "mx01.mail.icloud.com",
      prio = 10,
    },
    "mx2" = {
      type = "MX",
      name = "@",
      data = "mx02.mail.icloud.com",
      prio = 10,
    },
    "spf" = {
      type = "TXT",
      name = "@",
      data = "\"v=spf1 include:icloud.com ~all\""
    },
  }
}

# with names like `godaddy-dns_record.records["mx"]`
resource "godaddy-dns_record" "records" {
  for_each = local.records
  domain   = "mydomain.com"
  type     = each.value.type
  name     = each.value.name
  data     = each.value.data
  priority = lookup(each.value, "prio", null)
}
