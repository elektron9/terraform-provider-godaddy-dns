# GoDaddy DNS management provider: `godaddy-dns`

This module allows to manage individual DNS resource records for domains hosted on GoDaddy DNS servers, using [management API](https://developer.godaddy.com/).

It deals only with DNS resources (no e.g. domain management) and aims to manage individual DNS resource records (not the whole domain), while preserving exising records and tolerating external modifications (as far as possible).

Provider configuration is pretty trivial and usually empty, providing that authentication info is set in environment variables `GODADDY_API_KEY` and `GODADDY_API_SECRET` (see developer docs above for instructions on how to get them). Alternatively, they could be set in `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters in provider configuration.

# DNS Record resource : `dns_record`

DNS RRs are described as instances of `dns_records` resource.

It currently supports `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS` and `TXT` records, the only
omission being `SRV` (if anyone hosting AD on GoDaddy or uses them for VOIP or something like that, please let me know by creating an issue).

Example usage:

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

To set several records, use `for_each`:

{{ tffile "examples/several_records/main.tf" }}
