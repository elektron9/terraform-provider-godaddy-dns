# GoDaddy DNS management provider: `godaddy-dns`

This plug-in enables the managment of individual DNS resource records for domains hosted on GoDaddy DNS servers, using [the management API](https://developer.godaddy.com/).

It only manages DNS resources (no e.g. domain management) and aims to manage individual DNS resource records (not the whole domain), while preserving existant records and tolerating external modifications.

## Usage

Provider configuration is pretty trivial and usually empty, providing that authentication info is set in environment variables `GODADDY_API_KEY` and `GODADDY_API_SECRET` (see developer docs above for instructions on how to get them). Alternatively, they could be set in `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters in provider configuration.

## DNS Record resource : `dns_record`

DNS RRs are described as instances of `dns_records` resource.

It currently supports `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS` and `TXT` records. `SRV` are not supported; if anyone hosting AD on GoDaddy or uses them for VOIP or something like that, please let me know by creating an issue.

Example usage:

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

To set several records, use `for_each`:

{{ tffile "examples/several_records/main.tf" }}

## Differences vs alternative providers

Differences vs n3integration provider and its forks:
- granularity: top-level configuration object is record, not domain
- updates do not result in scary plans threatening to destroy all the records in whole domain
- external modifications are mostly ok: update will not complain if record is already set to the desired state
- `destroy` is fully supported
